# Abair

**Irish Speech and Language Technologies**

## Synopsis

This is the source code for the Abair project.

## Aims

The main aim of the Abair project is to bring state-of-the-art Irish speech and language technologies to the public. This web application is one means by which this aim is achieved.

This codebase is designed with two audiences in mind:

1. Public
2. Developers

For the public, abair.ie should provide easy, reliable access to the technologies and applications across all devices, with an excellent user experience. To achieve this, the interface must be simple, clean, fast, responsive, consistent and intuitive.

For developers, joining and contributing to the project should be made as straightforward as possible. Minimalist, modular code with comprehensive documentation and robust testing is employed to produce a codebase of reusable components. This makes it easy to get to grips with, and fun to work with.
